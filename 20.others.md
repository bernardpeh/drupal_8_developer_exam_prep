## Useful Modules

It is not required to study this for exam but there are some really useful modules that is good to know

1. Paragraphs module acts like a new content type and it has a new entry under the structure menu. Adding fields to paragraphs is like adding fieldsto content type. Then in content type, you can add a paragraph field. The end result is like nesting content types.

2. pathauto helps content editors to create new content without the need to worry about urls.

3. devel helps to generate dummy content and provide the webprofiler toolbar. Users of Symfony will find it familiar.

## Logging

It is always good to log things to help troubleshooting.

```
-> \Drupal::service('logger.factory')->get('test')->notice('this is a notice');

or

-> \Drupal::logger('Node Updates')->notice('Node with title %NODE_TITLE% of type
%NODE_TYPE% has been updated', [
			'%NODE_TITLE%' => $entity->label(),
			'%NODE_TYPE%' => $entity->bundle(),
		]);
```
