Now with drupal 8, its system configuration can be exported and imported easily.

Go to configuration -> development -> configuration synchronisation

The configuration dir can be configured in settings.php

```
# settings.php
...
$config_directories['sync'] = '../config/sync';
```

It is possible to run the export on command line

```
-> drupal ce
```

likewise for import.

```
-> drupal ci
```

It is useful to commit the files and deploy the config in this way.

## Migrating DB

It is possible migrate db in csv.

1. install and activate "migrate plus", "migrate tools" and "migrate source csv".

2. put the csv in the temp file folder configured in /admin/config/media/file-system

3. go to admin -> config -> development -> synchronize -> import -> single item.

paste

```
id: import_actors
label: Migrate actors
migration_group: migrated_actors
source:
   plugin: csv
   path: public://actors.csv
   header_row_count: 1
   keys:
      - id
destination:
   plugin: entity:node
process:
   title: name
   type:
       plugin: default_value
       default_value: actors

```

and for entity reference fields
 
```
