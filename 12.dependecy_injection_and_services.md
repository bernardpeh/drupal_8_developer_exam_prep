Drupal DI and services is borrowed from Symfony. It should be familiar for Symfony developers.


It is possible to call services from anywhere using 

```
\Drupal::service('service_name');
```

Services can be discovered from command line, ie `drupal container:debug`

You can define a new service using `drupal generate:service`

A typical service definition lives in modulename.services.yml

```
services:
  module_test.event:
    class: Drupal\module_test\EventSubscriber\TestSubscriber
    arguments: ['@current_user']
    tags:
      - { name: event_subscriber }
```
