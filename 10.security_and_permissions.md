1. It is possible to limit the access block content under structure -> block layout -> configure -> visibility. You can restrict by content type, pages (url) or roles.

2. It is possible to create new roles with certain access rights under people -> roles. Permissions can be managed via people -> permissions.

3. If you create a new module. You can create new permissions in the route, eg

```
rsvplist.report:
  path: '/admin/reports/rsvplist'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\rsvplist\Controller\ReportController::report'
    _title: 'List of RSVPs'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'view rsvplist'
```

where "view rsvp" is defined in modulename.permissions.yml. The file will look like

```
view rsvplist:
  title: 'View RSVP Form'
  description: 'View and submit the RSVP form.'
access rsvplist report:
  title: 'Access List of RSVPs'
  description: 'View the report listing all RSVPs submitted.'
administer rsvplist:
  title: 'Administer RSVP Settings'
  description: 'Access the RSVP administrative settings page.'
  restrict access: true
```
