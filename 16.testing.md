To enable automated testing, enable the testing module.

## Unit Test

* Define a class that extends \Drupal\Tests\UnitTestCase.
* The class name needs to end in the word Test.
* The namespace must be a subspace/subdirectory of \Drupal\yourmodule\Tests, where yourmodule is your module's machine name.
* The test class file must be named and placed under the yourmodule/tests/src/Unit directory, according to the PSR-4 standard.
* Your test class needs a phpDoc comment block with a description and a @group annotation, which gives information about the test.
* Add test cases by adding method names that start with 'test' and have no arguments, for example testYourTestCase(). Each one should test a logical subset of the functionality.

## Functional Test

* For functional tests of the web output of Drupal, define a class that extends \Drupal\simpletest\WebTestBase, which contains an internal web browser and defines many helpful test assertion methods that you can use in your tests. You can specify modules to be enabled by defining a $modules member variable -- keep in mind that by default, WebTestBase uses a "testing" install profile, with a minimal set of modules enabled.
* For functional tests that do not test web output, define a class that extends \Drupal\KernelTests\KernelTestBase. This class is much faster than WebTestBase, because instead of making a full install of Drupal, it uses an in-memory pseudo-installation (similar to what the installer and update scripts use). To use this test class, you will need to create the database tables you need and install needed modules manually.
* The namespace must be a subspace/subdirectory of \Drupal\yourmodule\Tests, where yourmodule is your module's machine name.
* The test class file must be named and placed under the yourmodule/src/Tests directory, according to the PSR-4 standard.
* Your test class needs a phpDoc comment block with a description and a @group annotation, which gives information about the test.
* You may also override the default setUp() method, which can set be used to set up content types and similar procedures.
* In some cases, you may need to write a test module to support your test; put such modules under the yourmodule/tests/modules directory.
* Add test cases by adding method names that start with 'test' and have no arguments, for example testYourTestCase(). Each one should test a logical subset of the functionality. Each method runs in a new, isolated test environment, so it can only rely on the setUp() method, not what has been set up by other test methods.
